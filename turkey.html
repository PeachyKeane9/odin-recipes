    <h1>Thanksgiving Turkey Recipe</h1>
        <img class="turkey-pic" src="./images/Turkey.jpg" alt="Picture of Turkey" height="300" width="300">
    <h3> How To Make</h3>
    <h5>This turkey recipe uses orange wedges and aromatics to add flavor, while a champagne broth works its magic to keep the turkey moist and tender. My grandmother and mother passed this recipe on to me. It changes a little every Thanksgiving, because I've never written the recipe down before. But the roast turkey is always incredibly juicy and succulent!</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="turkey-ing">
        <li><strong>2 Tablespoons dried parsley</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 table spoons ground dried rosemary</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>2 table spoons dried sage</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>2 table spoons dried thyme leaves</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon lemon pepper</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoon salt</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 whole turkey</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 medium orange</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 medium onion</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 medium carrot</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>2 stalks celery, cut into ½-inch slices</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth</strong> </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roaster with sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap around turkey.</li>
            <li>Stir parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Rub herb mixture into turkey cavity, then stuff with orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery. Tie turkey legs together with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body.</li>
            <li>Place turkey on the foil in the roasting pan. Pour champagne and chicken broth over turkey, making sure to get some liquid in the cavity.</li>
            <li>Bring aluminum foil up and over the top of turkey and seal; try to keep the foil from touching the turkey./li>
            <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 2 ½ to 3 hours. Uncover turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 to 60 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
